# TOMCAT Processing

Collection of Python scripts used to process massive datasets of time-resolved synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy on water wicking in yarns

## Installation

Simply clone the repo and find out which python libraries you will need
requires my Python library robpylib Pescatore23/robpylib to run, mostly for image IO

## Usage

Those are scripts used for the specific analysis tasks that have evolved in quality over time and are not complete. Probably require adaption for any other use.
