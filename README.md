# TOMCAT Processing

Collection of Python scripts used to process massive datasets of time-resolved synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy on water wicking in yarns

## Installation

Simply clone the repo and find out which python libraries you will need
requires my Python library robpylib Pescatore23/robpylib to run, mostly for image IO

## Usage

Those are scripts used for the specific analysis tasks that have evolved in quality over time and are not complete. Probably require adaption for any other use.
The data is published in two datasets at:

https://doi.org/10.16907/b638b0f7-b8ab-4b10-8950-fa7a61e8e2b8
```

## Citation

The code was developed during my PhD project for the analysis of free energy evolution and pore network filling during wicking in yarns.
